> everything you need to build on Ethereum ERC-721A! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:


# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start
> install and start your root folder:

```bash
yarn install
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
yarn deploy
yarn etherscan-verify --network mainnet
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `.sol` in `./contracts`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `./deploy`
